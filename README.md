# Use the map Method to Extract Data from an Array 🎯 freeCodeCamp Challenge 
## Part 8 of the JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures Certification ✅
### Functional Programming Chapter ➡️ Challenge number 7 out of 24

- The `watchList` array holds objects with information on several movies ("Inception" 💭, "Interstellar" 🌌, "The Dark Knight" 🦸‍♂️, "Batman Begins" 🦇, "Avatar" 🧞‍♀️)
- Use `map` on `watchList` to assign a new array of objects to the `ratings` variable
- Each movie in the new array should have only a `title` key with the name of the film, and a `rating` key with the IMDB rating
- The code in the editor currently uses a `for` loop to do this, so you should replace the loop functionality with your `map` expression
